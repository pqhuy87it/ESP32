  Read the analog output value of the gas sensor and print it to the

  Note: After the sensor is powered on, it needs to be preheated for 
  at least 3 minute before stable measurement readings can be obtained. 
  It is normal for the sensor to generate heat during operation due to 
  the presence of a heating wire inside.
