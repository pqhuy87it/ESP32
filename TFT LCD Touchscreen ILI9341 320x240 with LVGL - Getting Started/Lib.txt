IMPORTANT :                                                                                   
- For the TFT_eSPI library :                                                                  
  > Open the "TFT_eSPI" library folder in your Arduino IDE libraries folder.                  
    If you are a window user, usually the location of the Arduino IDE libraries folder is in  
    "Documents -> Arduino -> libraries".                                                      
  > Replace the "User_Setup.h" file in the "TFT_eSPI" library folder with                     
    the "User_Setup.h" file that I have shared in the program code file                       
    (Delete the "User_Setup.h" file in the "TFT_eSPI" library folder,                         
    then copy the "User_Setup.h" file that I have shared in                                   
    the program code file to the "TFT_eSPI" library folder.)                                  
                                                                                              
- For the LVGL library :                                                                      
  Copy the "lv_conf.h" file to your Arduino IDE libraries folder                              
  (COPY THE "lv_conf.h" FILE TO THE ARDUINO IDE LIBRARIES FOLDER, NOT INTO THE "lvgl" FOLDER.)
